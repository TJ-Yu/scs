# Shanghai–Hangzhou High-Speed Rail Departure Station Choice Survey

## Research Background

We are conducting an academic study on passenger departure station choice at the Hangzhou railway hub (Hangzhou East Station and Hangzhou West Station) along the Shanghai–Hangzhou High-Speed Rail corridor.

This survey examines how fare incentives, service supply, ticket availability, accessibility, and habit affect passengers’ decisions to switch departure stations.

The survey is anonymous and used only for statistical analysis. It takes approximately 10–15 minutes to complete. Thank you for your participation.
